# 🕒 Digital Clock - Project #5

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Build a simple digital clock using Python that updates in real time. The clock should display current time with an attractive interface and include options for customization.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn:
- Time manipulation with `datetime` and `time` modules
- Creating GUI applications with `tkinter`
- Using `after()` method for live updates and animations
- Event-driven programming concepts
- GUI layout and styling
- Real-time application development

## 🔧 Features

- **Real-Time Display**: Updates every second automatically
- **Multiple Formats**: 12-hour and 24-hour time formats
- **Date Display**: Optional date information
- **Customizable Appearance**: Colors, fonts, and sizes
- **Multiple Time Zones**: Display time in different zones
- **Alarm Functionality**: Set alarms and notifications
- **Full-Screen Mode**: Immersive clock display

## 📋 Requirements

```
tkinter  # Usually included with Python installation
datetime # Built-in Python module
time     # Built-in Python module
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd week-1/05-digital-clock
```

2. Run the digital clock:
```bash
python main.py
```

For CLI version:
```bash
python main.py --cli
```
