# 🔢 Calculator (CLI) - Project #1

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Build a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn:
- Taking user input with `input()` function
- Writing and calling functions in Python
- Using conditional statements (if/else)
- Handling edge cases (like division by zero)
- Basic error handling with try/except

## 🔧 Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Error Handling**: Division by zero protection
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear menu and prompts
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid operators and numbers

## 📋 Requirements

```
# No external dependencies required - uses built-in Python modules only!
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd week-1/01-calculator
```

2. Run the calculator:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Function Definition and Calling
- Creating reusable functions for each operation
- Returning values from functions
- Parameter passing

### 2. User Input Handling
- Getting user input with `input()`
- Converting strings to numbers with `float()`
- Input validation

### 3. Conditional Logic
- Using if/elif/else statements
- Operator comparison
- Flow control

### 4. Error Handling
- Division by zero prevention
- Invalid input handling

## 📊 Sample Input/Output

### Sample Interaction:
```
=== Simple Calculator ===
Choose operation:
1. Add (+)
2. Subtract (-)
3. Multiply (*)
4. Divide (/)

Enter your choice (+, -, *, /): +
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0
```

### Division by Zero Example:
```
Enter your choice (+, -, *, /): /
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 0
Result: Error: Division by zero
```

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

After completing this project, you'll understand:
- How to structure a simple Python program
- Function creation and usage
- Basic input/output operations
- Error handling fundamentals
- Mathematical operations in Python

## 🏆 Bonus Challenges

1. **Add more operations**: Square root, power, modulo
2. **Memory function**: Store and recall previous results
3. **History**: Keep track of all calculations
4. **Advanced operations**: Trigonometric functions
5. **GUI version**: Create a graphical calculator using tkinter
